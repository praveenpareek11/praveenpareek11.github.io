#### The purpose is:
- To analyse the **Negative Review** (Text format) using **NLP techniques** to extract the **keywords** which are causing the negative reviews. It outputs the top 100 keywords each in unigram, bigram and trigram category.
e.g.
  - **unigram:** service, poor, old, noisy, dirty, rude, uncomfortable etc.
  - **bigram:** small room, customer service, extremely small, poor quality,poor breakfast, house keeping, pay extra etc.
  - **trigram:** room was small, member of staff, front desk staff, lot of noise, clean the room, need of refurbishment etc.

  **Similarly for Positive Review (Text format)**

- **Time Series Analysis** of the monthly traffic vs the average rating in that particular month.
